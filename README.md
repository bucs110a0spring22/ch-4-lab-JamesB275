## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
Got rid of some unneccesary turtle.penup() and turtle.pendown() statements. In the for loop, I fixed the range and made it (-360,361) because otherwise the 360 would be exclusive. 

Summary of function(s) added:
added raiseNumber function, and evenOrOdd function.

Summary of Feature Added:
The raiseNumber function will ask you for a number to raise to a power, and a power to raise the number by. For example, if you put in 3 as your number to raise by a power and 5 as your power to raise your number by, it would be 3^5. The evenOrOdd function then takes this value and decides if it is even or odd. For example, 3^5 is 243, so the evenOrOdd will print that the resulting number is odd.
